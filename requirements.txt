# Python version
# Python 3.8+ is recommended.

# External System Dependencies (install separately):
# 1. A LaTeX distribution (e.g., MiKTeX, TeX Live, MacTeX)
#    - Must include `pdflatex` (and optionally `xelatex`, `lualatex`)
# 2. `pdfinfo` command-line tool
#    - Often part of the `poppler-utils` package (or `xpdf` on some systems).
#    - On macOS (via Homebrew): `brew install poppler`
#    - On Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install poppler-utils`
#    - On Fedora: `sudo dnf install poppler-utils`

# No specific Python packages required by pip yet, beyond the standard library.
# If packages like `PyPDF2` were used for PDF manipulation (instead of pdfinfo),
# they would be listed here.
